## Campus Founders Startup Lingo overview 

This glossary helps you understand startup terms easily. It’s like a dictionary for startup language, covering everything from finance to tech talk. Whether you’re starting a business, investing in one, or just want to know more about startups. 

Content is stored in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/bulentevren/lingo) 
where you'll find a list of [issues](https://github.com/bulentevren/lingo/issues) and 
[discussions](https://github.com/bulentevren/lingo/discussions) about the glossary. 

## Who can contribute?

How you can participate in this project depends on your level of expertise. 
Simplifying complex concepts requires a deep knowledge of the topic. 
Therefore, to contribute new terms, you must be proficient in them. 


If you are not an expert yet but still want to contribute, we recommend teaming up with someone who is. 
Once the expert is confident that the term accurately describes the concept, you are ready for your Glossary contribution.

The localization effort is where beginners proficient in another language can make valuable contributions
